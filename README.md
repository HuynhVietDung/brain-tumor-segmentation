# brain-tumor-segmentation

This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with UNETR (UNet Transformer) for brain tumor segmentation using medical imaging datasets. It provides implementations, training scripts, and evaluation metrics to understand how UNETR performs in segmenting brain tumors from MRI scans.

Key features of this repository include:

* Dataset Handling: Preprocessing pipelines for medical imaging datasets (Figshare Brain Tumor dataset).
* Model Implementation: A PyTorch-based implementation of UNETR for segmentation tasks.
* Training and Evaluation: Scripts for training, validating, and testing the model on brain tumor segmentation datasets.
