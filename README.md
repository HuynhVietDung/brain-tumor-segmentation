# brain-tumor-segmentation

This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with [UNETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10504v3) (UNet Transformer) for brain tumor segmentation using medical imaging datasets. It provides implementations, training scripts, and evaluation metrics to understand how [UNETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10504v3) performs in segmenting brain tumors from MRI scans.

Key features of this repository include:

* Dataset Handling: Preprocessing pipelines for medical imaging datasets ([Figshare Brain Tumor dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilroxtomar/brain-tumor-segmentation/data)).
* Model Implementation: A Tensorflow-based implementation of UNETR for segmentation tasks.
* Training and Evaluation: Scripts for training, validating, and testing the model on brain tumor segmentation datasets.
